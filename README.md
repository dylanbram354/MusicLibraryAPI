# Overview

Music Library is a CRUD application utilizing a React.js frontend to allow users to manage a database of song data. Users can create, view, update, and delete song entries consisting of title, album, artist, genre, and release date. It was one of my earliest full-stack projects utilizing React.js as a student of devCodeCamp, and it was very helpful at introducing that new framework. This repo includes the backend, a Django REST API that interacts with a MySQL database.

### Technologies
